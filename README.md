## My story

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
Some of my earliest and fondest 
memories as a toddler consisted of late night car adventures 
and overnight stays in the suites of Guangzhou’s 
most prolific hotels. This was the result of my family’s 
heavy involvement in the hotel industry in the western 
parts of China. Specifically, the sensation of a warm 
and welcoming hotel lobby after a long day of work and 
travels presented me with great peace and comfort. 
As it was said by Diane von Furstenburg, 
*“When you get into a hotel room, you lock the door, 
and you know there is secrecy, there is a luxury, 
there is fantasy, there is comfort, and there is 
assurance”*. My ambition with this project is to share 
the luxuries and comforts, that I had once felt, with 
the touring individuals and families looking to capture 
an essence of the beauty within some of Asia’s most 
glorious destinations.

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
Balancing hotel hunting and planning the itinerary for 
your special work-trip, vacation, or stay-cation may seem 
like a daunting and overwhelming task. This application 
is designed to ease and simplify the process of hotel 
seeking for tourists and travellers looking to explore 
the Asian continent. Specifically, users will be able to 
state their desired destination and will promptly be 
greeted with various researched and reviewed hotel 
recommendations. In addition to this, consumers also 
have the ability to sort their generated results based 
on both price and location. Moreover, once a hotel has 
caught the interest of a user, they will be able to add 
that hotel to their list where they can read a writeup about the hotel and access the hotel’s official website.
